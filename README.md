# My Notes
This repository is to collect my notes on JavaScript, CSS, and more while I am studying from various sources to hone my skills.  Notes are written in my native language, Myanmar(Burmese), and the primary intention is not to teach others but to have a place for me to search my notes when needed.  If you find my notes useful for your project or your own study, I am glad.  Cheers!
